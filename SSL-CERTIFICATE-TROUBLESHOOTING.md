# SSL Certificate Troubleshooting for ikigain.org

## Issue Analysis (July 23, 2025)

### Current SSL Certificate Status
- **Certificate Subject**: `CN = replit.app` (WRONG - should be ikigain.org)
- **Issuer**: Google Trust Services 
- **Problem**: Replit serving generic certificate instead of custom domain certificate
- **Duration**: 24+ hours since DNS configuration completion

### Root Cause
Replit's automatic SSL certificate provisioning has not triggered for `ikigain.org` despite:
- ✅ Correct DNS configuration (CNAME @ → www.ikigain.org)
- ✅ Domain added to REPLIT_DOMAINS environment variable
- ✅ Proper TXT verification record in place

### Technical Solutions Implemented

#### 1. ACME Challenge Handler
- Added `/.well-known/acme-challenge/:token` endpoint to server
- Enables Let's Encrypt domain verification for SSL generation
- Bypasses redirect middleware for challenge requests

#### 2. Static Challenge Files
- Created `public/.well-known/acme-challenge/` directory structure
- Added verification files for domain ownership proof
- Accessible via HTTP for Let's Encrypt validation

#### 3. Improved Redirect Logic
- Simplified redirect to always use HTTP 301 redirect
- Removed complex HTTPS handling that might interfere with SSL provisioning
- Maintained proper ACME challenge bypass

### Next Steps for Manual SSL Triggering

#### Option 1: Replit Dashboard
1. Go to Replit project dashboard
2. Navigate to "Deployments" or "Custom Domains" section
3. Re-add or refresh ikigain.org domain configuration
4. Force SSL certificate regeneration

#### Option 2: Contact Replit Support
If automatic provisioning continues to fail:
- Submit support ticket about SSL certificate not generating
- Reference domain: ikigain.org
- Mention 24+ hour wait time exceeded

#### Option 3: Alternative SSL Provider
Consider using Cloudflare as DNS proxy with their free SSL certificates:
- Point DNS to Cloudflare
- Enable Cloudflare SSL/TLS encryption
- Configure Cloudflare to proxy traffic to Replit

### Expected Resolution
With ACME challenge infrastructure in place, SSL certificate should generate within:
- **Best Case**: 30 minutes to 2 hours
- **Typical Case**: 4-8 hours  
- **Manual Intervention**: Contact Replit support if no progress after 12 hours

### Verification Commands
```bash
# Check SSL certificate
echo | openssl s_client -servername ikigain.org -connect ikigain.org:443 2>/dev/null | openssl x509 -noout -subject

# Test ACME challenge
curl http://ikigain.org/.well-known/acme-challenge/test-challenge
```

### Success Indicators
When SSL certificate is properly generated:
- Certificate subject will show `CN = ikigain.org`
- HTTPS access to ikigain.org will work without warnings
- Both ikigain.org and www.ikigain.org will have valid SSL certificates
