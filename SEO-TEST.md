# SEO Dynamic Implementation Test

## What has been implemented:

### 1. Route-specific SEO Configuration (`client/src/lib/seoConfig.ts`)
- Comprehensive mapping of all routes to specific meta titles and descriptions
- Dynamic canonical URL generation
- Language-aware URL handling
- Structured data generation for each route type

### 2. Dynamic SEO Hook (`client/src/hooks/useDynamicSEO.ts`)  
- Automatic meta tag updates based on current route
- Proper canonical URL setting for each page
- Language alternates (hreflang) setup
- Structured data injection
- Real-time updates when route changes

### 3. Integration in App Component
- Added `useDynamicSEO()` hook to main App component
- Now automatically handles SEO for all routes

## Route Examples:

| URL | Expected Title | Expected Description |
|-----|----------------|---------------------|
| `/` | "Ikigai Test - Discover Your Life Purpose \| Ikigain" | "Discover your Ikigai with our comprehensive personality test..." |
| `/blog` | "Ikigai Blog - Insights on Living with Purpose \| Ikigain" | "Explore authentic insights on ikigai, purpose, and meaningful living..." |
| `/test` | "Ikigai Test - Find Your Life Purpose \| Ikigain" | "Take our comprehensive Ikigai test to discover your life purpose..." |
| `/about` | "About Us - Our Story \| Ikigain" | "Meet Sindy, founder of Ikigain. Learn how her personal journey..." |
| `/ikigai-types/builder` | "The Builder - Ikigai Personality Type \| Ikigain" | "Discover the Builder Ikigai type: practical, action-oriented..." |

## Canonical URLs:
- English: `https://www.ikigain.org/[path]`
- Spanish: `https://www.ikigain.org/es/[path]`
- French: `https://www.ikigain.org/fr/[path]`

## Test this by:
1. Navigate to different routes in the app
2. Check browser dev tools Elements tab
3. Look for `<title>`, `<meta name="description">`, and `<link rel="canonical">` tags
4. Verify they change based on the current route

## Console logs will show:
```
Setting canonical URL for [route]: https://www.ikigain.org/[path]
```

The SEO system is now fully dynamic and will provide different meta content for each route!
