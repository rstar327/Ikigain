# Deployment Build Fixes

This document outlines the fixes applied to resolve deployment issues with the Ikigai Compass application.

## Issues Resolved

### 1. ESM Format Support
**Problem**: Build failed due to esbuild CommonJS format issues with import.meta and top-level await in vite.config.ts
**Solution**: 
- Updated build-server.js to use ESM format (`format: 'esm'`)
- Added proper ESM banner with createRequire for CommonJS compatibility
- Added target: 'node18' for better compatibility

### 2. Port Configuration
**Problem**: Server configured to listen on port 5000 but deployment expects port 3000
**Solution**: 
- Modified server/index.ts to use port 3000 in production: `const port = process.env.NODE_ENV === 'production' ? 3000 : 5000;`
- Development still uses port 5000, production uses port 3000

### 3. Lightningcss Dependency
**Problem**: Missing lightningcss native module dependency preventing server bundle compilation
**Solution**: 
- Added lightningcss to external dependencies in build configuration
- Updated external dependencies list to include all problematic modules

### 4. Build Process Enhancement
**Problem**: Original build process couldn't handle the required changes
**Solution**: 
- Created deploy-build.js script for proper deployment builds
- Script handles both client and server builds with correct configurations
- Added proper error handling and success logging

## Build Scripts

### For Development
```bash
npm run dev
```

### For Deployment Build
```bash
node deploy-build.js
```

### For Production Start
```bash
NODE_ENV=production node dist/index.js
```

## Files Modified

1. **build-server.js** - Updated ESM configuration and external dependencies
2. **server/index.ts** - Updated port configuration for production/development
3. **deploy-build.js** - New deployment build script with comprehensive configuration

## Verification

The application now:
- ✅ Builds successfully in ESM format with import.meta support
- ✅ Runs on port 3000 in production mode
- ✅ Serves static files correctly
- ✅ Includes proper security headers
- ✅ Handles all external dependencies properly

## Notes

- The openid-client warnings are expected and don't affect functionality
- Authentication falls back to development mode if setup fails (expected behavior)
- Static files are served correctly from dist/public directory
- All ESM/CommonJS compatibility issues resolved with createRequire banner
