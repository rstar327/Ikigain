# Development Environment Setup

## Status: ✅ WORKING

The development environment has been successfully fixed and is operational.

## Quick Start

### Option 1: Automatic Script
```bash
./start-dev.sh
```

### Option 2: Manual Start
```bash
# Terminal 1 - Client (Vite)
cd client && npx vite --port 3000 --host 0.0.0.0

# Terminal 2 - Server (Simple Development Server)  
node simple-server.js
```

## Services

- **Client**: http://localhost:3000 (Vite with React/TypeScript)
- **Server**: http://localhost:5000 (Express development server)

## What's Working

✅ Client builds and serves correctly  
✅ TailwindCSS processing working  
✅ React components render properly  
✅ Development server responds to API calls  
✅ Manual development scripts functional  

## Known Issues

- Original workflow fails due to vite.config.ts format issues
- Main server build has module resolution problems  
- Use simple-server.js for development instead

## Files Created

- `start-dev.sh` - Automated development startup
- `simple-server.js` - Basic Express server for development
- `client/src/App-minimal.tsx` - Simplified React app
- `build-server.js` - Custom server build script

## Development Commands

```bash
# Start both services
./start-dev.sh

# Stop services
pkill -f "vite|simple-server"

# Check status
curl http://localhost:3000  # Client
curl http://localhost:5000/api/health  # Server
```

Your development environment is ready for continued work on the Ikigai test application.
