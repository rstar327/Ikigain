  "introduction": {
    "title": "More than just \"life purpose\"",
    "description": "The word ikigai comes from <strong>iki</strong> (to live) and <strong>gai</strong> (value). At its heart, it means your \"reason for being.\" But don't worry—it doesn't have to be climbing Everest or solving a global issue.",
    "quote": "Ikigai can be small. It can be the joy of your morning routine.",
    "author": "Ken Mogi, Neuroscientist",
    "examples": {
      "coffee": "The first sip of coffee while the world is still quiet",
      "garden": "Tending to your garden before the day begins",
      "walk": "Walking your dog along the same peaceful path every morning"
    },
    "conclusion": "Your reason for being might already be in the little things—the quiet moments, the daily rituals, the simple joys. That's where the beauty lives."
  },
  "dailyLife": {
    "title": "A concept rooted in daily life",
    "description": "Unlike Western ideas of purpose that often revolve around career goals or self-actualization, ikigai is personal and practical. It's not something to chase or measure, it's something you live and feel.",
    "example": "A teacher might find it in their students, a retiree in their garden. It's about doing what feels meaningful, even in simple things.",
    "research": "Psychologist Mieko Kamiya, who studied ikigai in the 1960s, described it as a sense of life's value - especially important during hardship. That's part of its quiet power: ikigai isn't about success. It's about significance."

  "westernDiscovery": {
    "title": "How the Western world discovered Ikigai",
    "description": "While ikigai has shaped Japanese life for centuries, it only gained global attention recently. The 2016 book \"Ikigai: The Japanese Secret to a Long and Happy Life\" popularized the idea worldwide, especially through a four-circle diagram.",
    "helpful": "Helpful?",
    "helpfulAnswer": "Yes.",
    "traditional": "Traditionally Japanese?",
    "traditionalAnswer": "Not quite.",
    "conclusion": "In Japan, ikigai isn't a diagram - it's a feeling. And you don't need to tick four boxes to have it."
  },
  "westernInterpretation": {
    "title": "The Western (mis)interpretation",
    "description": "Traditionally, ikigai in Japan is deeply rooted in what you love and what gives your days a sense of purpose. Still, it's also worth considering the other three pillars that are not part of the traditional meaning—what you're good at, what the world needs, and what you can be paid for.",
    "why": "Why? Because when these areas align, they don't just bring joy—they create balance. They help you flourish, stay focused, and build a life that's both fulfilling and sustainable.",

    "questions": {
      "q1": "What does Ikigai mean in Japanese?",
      "a1": "Ikigai (生き甲斐) combines two Japanese words: 'iki' meaning 'life' and 'gai' meaning 'value' or 'worth.' It literally translates to 'reason for being' or 'life's purpose.' The concept has been central to Japanese culture for over 1,000 years.",
      "q2": "How do you pronounce Ikigai?",
      "a2": "Ikigai is pronounced 'ee-kee-guy' (ē-kē-gī). The emphasis is placed evenly across all three syllables, with each vowel sound clearly articulated.",
      "q3": "What are the 4 pillars of Ikigai?", 
      "a3": "The 4 pillars of Ikigai are: What You Love (passion), What You're Good At (skills), What the World Needs (mission), and What You Can Be Paid For (profession). While this framework was popularized in the West, traditional Japanese Ikigai focuses more on what brings joy and meaning to daily life.",
      "q4": "How do I find my Ikigai?",
      "a4": "To find your Ikigai, start with deep self-reflection on what brings you joy, your natural talents, how you can contribute to others, and what activities make you lose track of time. Our free Ikigai test can guide you through this discovery process with scientifically-backed questions.",
      "q5": "Is Ikigai just a Japanese concept?",
      "a5": "While Ikigai originated in Japan and remains deeply rooted in Japanese culture, the search for life purpose is universal. Many cultures have similar concepts - the Greek 'eudaimonia,' the Danish 'hygge,' or the German 'Lebensinn' - but Ikigai offers a unique, practical framework for finding meaning.",
      "q6": "Can Ikigai change over time?",
      "a6": "Absolutely. Your Ikigai can evolve as you grow, gain new experiences, and your life circumstances change. What brought you purpose at 25 may be different from what fulfills you at 45. The key is staying connected to what currently brings you joy and meaning."
