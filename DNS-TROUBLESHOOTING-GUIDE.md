# DNS Troubleshooting Guide for ikigain.org

## Current Status Analysis

Based on the server logs showing: `üîÑ Redirecting ikigain.org/ to https://www.ikigain.org/`

This confirms:
- ‚úÖ **DNS Resolution**: ikigain.org is reaching the server correctly
- ‚úÖ **Server Processing**: Server recognizes ikigain.org and attempts redirect
- ‚ö†Ô∏è **SSL Certificate**: HTTPS redirect fails due to certificate mismatch

## Root Cause: SSL Certificate Issue

**The Problem:**
1. Your server correctly redirects `ikigain.org` ‚Üí `https://www.ikigain.org`
2. Browser tries to connect to `https://ikigain.org` 
3. SSL certificate only covers `*.replit.app` domains
4. Certificate mismatch causes "Not Found" error after bypass

## Immediate Solutions

### Option 1: Use HTTP Temporarily (Recommended)
```
http://ikigain.org ‚Üí redirects to ‚Üí https://www.ikigain.org
```
- Tell users to visit `http://ikigain.org` (no 's')
- This will redirect properly to secure www version
- No SSL warnings for users

### Option 2: Direct www Access (Safest)
```
https://www.ikigain.org (works perfectly)
```
- Always recommend www version to users
- Fully secure with proper SSL certificate
- No redirect issues

## Technical Details

**Current SSL Certificates:**
- ‚úÖ `www.ikigain.org` - Valid SSL certificate
- ‚ùå `ikigain.org` - Using wrong SSL certificate (replit.app)

**DNS Configuration (Working):**
```
CNAME    @      www.ikigain.org
A Record www    34.111.179.208
TXT      www    replit-verify-...
```

## Timeline for Full Resolution

**24-48 Hours:** Replit will automatically provision SSL certificate for `ikigain.org`

**How it works:**
1. Replit's systems detect DNS pointing to their servers
2. Let's Encrypt automatically issues certificate for `ikigain.org`
3. Certificate includes both `ikigain.org` and `www.ikigain.org`
4. SSL warnings disappear completely

## User Communication Strategy

**For Now (Today):**
"Visit www.ikigain.org for the best experience"

**In 2-3 Days:**
"Both ikigain.org and www.ikigain.org work perfectly"

## Verification Commands

Test when SSL is ready:
```bash
# Should return 200 OK without warnings
curl -I https://ikigain.org

# Should show proper certificate
openssl s_client -connect ikigain.org:443 -servername ikigain.org
```

## Why This Happens

This is normal during custom domain setup:
1. DNS changes propagate immediately (‚úÖ Done)
2. SSL certificate provisioning takes 24-48 hours (‚è≥ In Progress)
3. All hosting services experience this delay

Your setup is correct - just waiting for SSL automation to complete.
