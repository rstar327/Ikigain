# Immediate Solution for ikigain.org SSL Issue

## Problem Summary
After 24+ hours, Replit has not automatically provisioned an SSL certificate for `ikigain.org`. The domain is still serving a generic `replit.app` certificate instead of a custom certificate.

## Immediate Actions Required

### 1. Manual Replit Configuration Check
You need to access your Replit project dashboard and check the custom domain settings:

1. Go to your Replit project: https://replit.com/@karlisvilmanis/ikigai-compass
2. Click on "Deployments" or "Settings" tab
3. Look for "Custom Domains" section
4. Verify that `ikigain.org` is properly configured
5. If present, try removing and re-adding the domain
6. If not present, add `ikigain.org` as a custom domain

### 2. Contact Replit Support
Since automatic SSL provisioning has failed after 24+ hours:

**Support Request Template:**
```
Subject: SSL Certificate Not Generated for Custom Domain ikigain.org

Hello Replit Support,

I have a custom domain ikigain.org configured for my project, but after 24+ hours, the SSL certificate has not been automatically generated.

Project: ikigai-compass (karlisvilmanis)
Domain: ikigain.org
DNS Configuration: CNAME @ → www.ikigain.org (properly configured)
TXT Record: replit-verify-... (in place)

Current Issue:
- https://ikigain.org returns SSL certificate for "replit.app" instead of "ikigain.org"
- This causes "Not Secure" warnings and connection issues

Request: Please manually trigger SSL certificate generation for ikigain.org or advise on next steps.

Thank you!
```

### 3. Alternative Quick Fix
While waiting for SSL resolution, you can:

1. **Redirect all traffic to www version** (which works perfectly)
2. **Update all marketing materials** to use www.ikigain.org
3. **Use www.ikigain.org in all links** and social media

## Current Status
- ✅ www.ikigain.org - Works perfectly with valid SSL
- ✅ http://ikigain.org - Redirects properly to www version  
- ❌ https://ikigain.org - Shows SSL warning, serves wrong certificate

## Expected Resolution
- **With Replit Support**: 1-2 business days
- **With Manual Configuration**: Few hours
- **With Alternative Provider**: Same day (if switching to Cloudflare)

The core infrastructure is correct. This is a hosting provider SSL provisioning issue that requires manual intervention after the automatic process failed.
